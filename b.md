## ABSOLUTE DON'Ts

| Don't                     | Explanation                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Look cheap**            | Free ≠ Cheap. We're quality, just with a different business model.               |
| **Pushy sales**           | Don't sell to people who don't need it. Offer solutions to people with problems. |
| **Look scammy**           | "Free" means free. No hidden fees. 100% transparent.                             |
| **Break promises**        | 48 hours means 48 hours. Don't promise what you can't deliver.                   |
| **Destroy trust**         | Break it once, lose it forever. Every relationship is built on trust.            |
| **Overwhelm with jargon** | Say "automatic connection" not "API integration."                                |
| **Self-praise**           | Show results, not compliments.                                                   | :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}
